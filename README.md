# exeuntu

exeuntu is available at https://ghcr.io/lollipopkit/exeuntu

exeuntu is the default base image for [exe.dev](https://exe.dev/). It is kitted-out
for developers, based on ubuntu24.04, and includes systemd.

We believe that minimal containers make for terrible developer (and agent)
experiences, so exeuntu includes a lot of stuff, mostly from apt.

You can build exeuntu with Docker, but running it, including systemd,
is difficult with Docker.
